# Lip-Reader

This repository contains a machine learning model designed for lip reading using the LipNet library and imageio. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (Lip_Reader.ipynb) that covers the entire process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing.

# Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. The required dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install them using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
The main component of this repository is the Jupyter Notebook:

Lip_Reader.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the lip reading model using LipNet and imageio.
# Running the Notebook
Open the Notebook:
Open Lip_Reader.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Follow the Instructions:
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.

# Data Preprocessing
The Lip_Reader.ipynb notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, which typically involve:

1.Loading the Data: Load video files containing lip movements along with corresponding text labels.

2.Frame Extraction: Use imageio to extract frames from the video files.

3.Normalization: Normalize the pixel values of the frames for better model performance.

4.Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

# Model Training
The Lip_Reader.ipynb notebook covers the following steps for model training:

1.Model Definition: Define the LipNet model architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.

2.Compile the Model: Compile the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers suitable for sequence-to-sequence learning.

3.Train the Model: Train the model on the preprocessed data, adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size for optimal performance.

# Model Evaluation and Testing
The Lip_Reader.ipynb notebook includes comprehensive evaluation and testing of the model:

1.Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics such as accuracy, loss, and word error rate (WER) to evaluate the model's performance.

2.Visualization: Visualize the training process with plots for accuracy and loss over epochs.

3.Model Testing: Test the trained model on the test set to assess its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
